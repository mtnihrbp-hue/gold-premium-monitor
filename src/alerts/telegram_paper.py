"""PAPER (SP-D): the brave analyst's trade push and its 21:00 report.

DRAFT for the owner's review (2026-10-04). Labelled PAPER everywhere: the account is
hypothetical and its BUY/SELL are what it did, not a signal; the system's own BUY alert
keeps its authority. Plain words, read on a phone: grams, toman, the venue, the reason,
the account after the trade, and the trader's next move in prices. Dates in the Persian
calendar, which is how the quarters run. Only <b> and <i>; no bare "<", ">" or "&".
